## About Me

I am a Front-End Developer focused on building responsive and reliable interfaces with clear user experience.

Alongside development, I teach English privately to individual students, which strengthened my communication, empathy, and ability to simplify complex topics in collaborative environments.

I work best in teams that value ownership, thoughtful decisions, and consistent delivery quality.
